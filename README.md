# Dorian

Dorian is a collection of scripts and configuration files to setup a new machine. It is mainly used for my personal setup, but feel free to use it for your own setup. I use it on Ubuntu 22.04, but it should work on other Linux distributions as well. I don't know if it works on Windows or MacOS.

### Installation files:

- VSCode
- Github CLI
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Rust (Language)
- Signal (Communication)
- Poetry

### Setup files:

- Basic Aliases
- Script Aliases (for the scripts in the `Scripts` folder)
- Basic Git Config
- Terminal Config

### Scripts:

Usable after running Script Aliases.

- `genpoetry NAME` - Creates a new poetry project with the given name.
- `genpoetryrust NAME` - Creates a new poetry project with the given name and adds a rust backend with maturin.

You can find some vscode extension recommendations in the `vscode` folder.
